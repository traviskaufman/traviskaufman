We sit in clothes, on a chair, in a house, with lights, electricity, running water, air conditioning, etc. We retrieve meals without moving an inch or saying a word. We store our money all across the world and spend it as if it were right in our pockets. Maybe most importantly of all, we have a little briefcase-like device made from glass and wire that can connect you to all of the information in the world; and it’s considered inefficient if it can’t do that in under 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, 100 years ago people probably felt the same way I do now, and 100 years from now people will probably feel the same way as well. The irony is that every 100 years people say about the people who lived a century before them: “I can’t believe how they lived without […]!!”</p>
<p>Think about it: forget 100 years go, how about 30 years? Have you ever thought “I don’t know how I’d live without my cell phone”? People living in the 70s lived without them every day. Forget 30 years ago, let’s talk 10 years ago. Some people can’t live without their smart phone apps, but when the new millenium rang the phrase “angry birds” was still being used in a (presumably) highly negative context.</p>
<p>But now these technologies do exist. And they’re awesome. Because they make your life easier. And when your life’s easier you feel better. And when you feel better, you’re happier. And when you’re happier, you share that happiness with the people around you. And then the world becomes a better place. All because you could order food at the touch of a button, see in an instant what everyone in your life you care about is doing, and find out more than you’d ever care to know about anything you may care about, a lot of the time discovering new things on the way. And that is the most beautiful thing in the world.</p>
<p>And that is why I have devoted my life to the art of developing software.</p>
